The eco system idea is one that would allow a user to hit play and watch as animals, insects, and natura in general
gets to self regulate and follow some systematic rules. 

This eco system idea, would ideally be pairable with procedural animations. Where some creature that is procedurally
animated, could follow one of these systemic-rules.


Idea
____

- Every living creature should have some basic form of needs to survive and reproduce. In order to keep this 'in-scope'
as much as possible, they will mostly be given the following across the board

- Living Type
- Age (and a max lifespan)
- Reproduction Requires Partner (true or false)
- Gender
- Size
- Hunger
- Speed
- Health Condition
- Natural Strength
- Natural Defense
- Travel Type {ground, water, air} (could do more like caves and trees)

- With the above variables, each type should have all the information it needs to live, thrive, or die. Some general
formulas will be used that will not be entirely accurate. For example, the reproduction age for every creature is 
different. Again, to save on scope, I will be assuming that all creatures are ready to reproduce within the 15%-40% of
their lifespan. Time will move at a multiple to provide faster results.

Types of <Living>
____

The Chain should be broken up into;
- herbivore = eats foliage & insects
- omnivore = eats anything, but might prioritize meat, then foliage, then insects
- insects = eats foliage
- foliage = spawns on it's own and always, but the rate depends


Rules
_____


1) Death Conditions
	- Age	>= 100%
	- Health = 0%
	- Hunger = 0%

2) Normal Constants
	- Time +
	- Age +
	- Hunger -

3) Special Constants
(increase until a certain Age %, then decrease)
	- Size
	- Speed
	- Health
	- Attack
	- Defense


4) Reproduction
	- When in the correct age %
	- Watches for opposite gender also within age % ||OR|| Releases Eggs/Seeds to fertalize/be fertalized
	- Once both creatures or eggs/seeds connect, then they are both put on a cooldown for reproduction
	- X time later, there is additional  

5) Senses
	- Radius (estimation of vision

5) Movement
	- Idle when meters are healthy
	- Intentional Based on least-healthy meter

6) Being Hunted
	- Run
	- Fight
	- Idle


First Testables
_______________

A) Since Foliage is the most important I want to get the following to be able to reproduce and spread;
	- Tree
	- Bush
	- Grass

B) Once Foliage can grow I'll introduce Insects to speed up the process;
	- Bees/Wasps
	- Pray Mantis
	- Beetles/LadyBugs

C) Once Insects can grow I'll introduce herbivores;
	- Antelope
	- Beaver
	- Cow/Bull

D) Once Herbivores are living, I can finish off with omnivores;
	- Bears
	- Birds
	- Dogs/Foxes/Wolfs
